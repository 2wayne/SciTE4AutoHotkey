<h3>SciTE4AutoHotkey v3 beta 4 installation</h3>

<p>Welcome! This program will download &amp; install SciTE4AutoHotkey.
If you want to perform an offline installation download the offline package first.</p>

<h4>Information for users of earlier betas</h4>

<p>This installer will first uninstall betas 1, 2 and 3 before installing beta 4.
Settings from beta 3 will be kept, as barely anything has changed in the format.</p>

<p>Beta 1, 2 and 3's broken AutoHotkey_L installation will be removed. Please use
the official installer instead or use the Porting Pack if build switching is needed.</p>

<p>Compile_AHK II is no longer included with SciTE4AutoHotkey but still supported.
Existing installations will be preserved. If you want to install Compile_AHK II then go to
the official forum thread:<br>http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic22975.html</p>
